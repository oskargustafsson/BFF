General
-------
- Add CommonJS support
- Add input validation (of calling arguments) to all exposed functions
- Docblocks
- Implement toString() for all modules

List
----
- Unit tests for all the extra functions
- Events "items:added", "items:replaced", "items:removed"
- Add "positionChanged" event to items. Args: [ newPosition, oldPosition, list, item ]
- UT: Props that depend on 'length' should trigger own change events when length changes
- Option to mixin lodash functions
  - or just implement some lodash funcs like union and intersection
- Throw error message if user tries to assign to list[-1] or list[list.length]
- Explore if there is a way to check if the user assigns outside of the array and throw an error.
  - Using Proxies? (FF + IE12)
  - Listening for internal Array "length" changes?

Record
------
- Cache calculated property values
- How to destroy a Record? Will they be garbage collected?

Event emitter
-------------
- Calling addEventListener() with the same arguments multiple times should have no effect. Maybe.

Event listener
--------------
- Write UTs for listenTo(anArray, ...)
- Option: useCapture

Extend
------

View
----
- FTs

Patch DOM
---------
- Option: idAttributes: [], a list of node attributes used to differentiate a list of otherwise indistinguishable nodes
- Smart algorithm for diffing lists of childNodes, based on their nodeNames
- SVG?
- FTs
