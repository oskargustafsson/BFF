General
-------
- Add CommonJS support
- Add input validation (of calling arguments) to all exposed functions
- Docblocks

List
----
- Add "remove" function, to remove an item in the List by passing it as the only parameter
- Add "clear" function that removes all items
- Add custom properties (no setters, just getters)
- Add dependencies to properties
- Add "positionChanged" event to items. Args: [ newPosition, oldPosition, list, item ]
- Option to mixin lodash functions
  - or just implement some lodash funcs like union and intersection
- Throw error message if user tries to assign to list[-1] or list[list.length]
- Explore if there is a way to check if the user assigns outside of the array and throw an error.
  - Using Proxies? (FF + IE12)
  - Listening for internal Array "length" changes?
- Unit tests for all the extra functions
- Modify functions so that they stay closer to their Array counterparts (sacrifice chainability)
- Rename pushArray to pushAll (it accepts a List as well as an Array)
- Make constructor accept a List a second arg (not just Array)
- UT negative index for .splice

Record

Event emitter

Event listener
