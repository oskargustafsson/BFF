General
-------
- Add CommonJS support
- Add input validation (of calling arguments) to all exposed functions
- Docblocks
- Implement toString() for all modules

List
----
- Unit tests for all the extra functions
- Events "items:added", "items:replaced", "items:removed"
- Add "positionChanged" event to items. Args: [ newPosition, oldPosition, list, item ]
- Option to mixin lodash functions
  - or just implement some lodash funcs like union and intersection
- Throw error message if user tries to assign to list[-1] or list[list.length]
- Explore if there is a way to check if the user assigns outside of the array and throw an error.
- Add dependencies to properties
  - Using Proxies? (FF + IE12)
  - Listening for internal Array "length" changes?

Record
------
- Dependencies are broken. Reimplement as follows: Dependent properties listens to prechange on their dependencies and stores their current values. Dependent properties also listens to change on their dependencies and triggers a change event, if they actually changed.
- How to destroy a Record?

Event emitter
-------------

Event listener
--------------
- Make it possible to listen to multiple events, like [ 'item:added' 'item:removed' ]
- Write UTs for listenTo(anArray, ...)
